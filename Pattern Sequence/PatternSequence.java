//The core goal of the program is to determine how many full repetitions of a target pattern p2 (repeated t2 times) can be derived from a longer source
//sequence, which is formed by repeating pattern p1 for t1 times. The condition is that we are allowed to remove characters from the source sequence (seqA),
//but we must preserve their original order â€” that is, characters cannot be rearranged.
//To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of times a given pattern p2 can be repeated such that the resulting sequence is a subsequence 
//of another sequence formed by repeating pattern p1 a specified number of times t1. The solution involves efficiently matching the patterns without explicitly 
//constructing the potentially enormous sequences, leveraging the periodicity of the sequences to optimize the matching process.
